                I ❤️ building stuff
            </h1>
        </div>

        <div class="my-5">
            <p>
                I write code for a living, <mark>specifically in the tertiary education sector</mark>. I try to write maintainable code, at least at the beginning of projects.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                I spend most of my time building and maintaining web applications with <mark>ASP.NET</mark> and <mark>PHP</mark> (mainly <mark>Laravel</mark> now). I work with <mark>MySQL</mark> and <mark>Microsoft SQL servers</mark>. Occasionally I get invited to teach.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                I am always excited about solving problems with software, though I do not think every problem can (or even should) be solved with software.
            </p>

        <h4 class="my-4 fw-bold">👨‍💻 Stuff I've worked on</h4>

        <h6 class="fw-bold mb-3 mt-4">
            👉 Sistem Ambilan Mahasiswa (SAM)
        </h6>

        <p>
            SAM started as an initiative with the Admissions Department to build an admission system that would act as a flexible and centralized top-of-the-funnel tool as UTMSPACE was diversifying into other products.
        </p>

        <p>
            I learned a lot about product development and how critical understanding users is in building products.
        </p>

        <h6 class="fw-bold mb-3 mt-4">
            👉 Sistem Maklumat Pelajar (SMP) v2
        </h6>

        <p>
            I rewrote SMP, an online academic management system for PSM (Program Separuh Masa) students. The old codebase was difficult to maintain and changes were hard to deploy. We implemented a CI/CD pipeline to automate builds and deployments.
        </p>

        <p>
            The user interface was revamped to be easier to use and we also added a feature that encouraged students to provide feedback.
        </p>

        <h6 class="fw-bold mb-3 mt-4">
            👉 Upgrade UTMSPACE’s payment gateway
        </h6>

        <p>
            I upgraded our payment gateway to conform to the changes introduced by FPX. We managed to save RM500,000 in development costs by reverse-engineering the existing system (which was outsourced) and rewriting it.
        </p>

        <h6 class="fw-bold mb-3 mt-4">
            👉 Introduced a CI/CD Environment
        </h6>

        <p>
            I helped set up a central code repository and build-server. Since then it has helped us enhance collaborations and has made deployments much simpler and less error-prone.
        </p>

        <h4 class="my-4 fw-bold">👨‍💻 What I'm working on (other than work)</h4>

        <h6 class="fw-bold mb-3 mt-4">
            👉 Mudeer
        </h6>

        <a class="mb-3 d-inline-block" href="https://mudeer.my/">mudeer.my</a>
        <p>
            A system for Quran & Arabic classes to better manage their students and teachers.
